    text: `I will be very straightforward - I hate sports and working out. 
        Positive Yoga put my physical activity to the next level. 
        I started to enjoy my morning yoga routines where I get my dose of cardio, resistance, and stretching in one place. 
        I could barely hold a plank at the beginning. Now I’m doing various yoga poses that looked impossible at first. 
        My body shape improved a lot and I am very motivated by both: results and the feeling of progress.`,

    text: `I have many friends who practice yoga and I decided to try it myself. 
        It is the best decision I have made in a long time. 
        With Positive Yoga program I started to lose weight, which was demotivating me for a long time. 
        Also, I’ve learned about yoga philosophy and poses that encourage me to practice mindfulness and pay attention to stress reduction. 
        I am very proud of myself. Feeling better is my biggest motivation.`,
